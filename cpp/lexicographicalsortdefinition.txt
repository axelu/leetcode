A string s is lexicographically greater than a string t if 
in the first position where s and t differ, string s has a letter 
that appears later in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in t. 

If the first min(s.length, t.length) characters do not differ, 
then the longer string is the lexicographically greater one.
